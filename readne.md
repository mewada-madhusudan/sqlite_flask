Key Concurrency Solutions:

Connection Pooling: Manages multiple connections with thread-safe access
WAL Mode: Enables better concurrent reads and writes
Retry Logic: Automatically retries operations when database is locked
Thread-Safe Design: Uses proper locking mechanisms

API Endpoints:
General

GET /health - Health check
POST /query - Execute custom SQL queries
GET /stats - Database statistics

User CRUD Operations

GET /users - Get all users (with pagination)
GET /users/<id> - Get specific user
POST /users - Create new user
PUT /users/<id> - Update user
DELETE /users/<id> - Delete user
POST /users/bulk - Bulk create users

Usage Examples:
bash# Create a user
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}'

# Execute custom query
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE ?", "params": ["%John%"]}'

# Bulk create users
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/users/bulk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"users": [{"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}, {"name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com"}]}'
To run the application:
bashpip install flask
python app.py
The API handles concurrent operations through:

Connection pooling with configurable limits
WAL journaling mode for better concurrency
Exponential backoff retry logic
Proper transaction handling
Thread-safe connection management
